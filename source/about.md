### Past
I completed my BSc degree in 2015 and my MSc degree in 2017 both in Informatics Engineering and both at the Faculty of Science of the University in Lisbon. During my MSc thesis I worked on an approach that superimposes a virtual overlay to all other interfaces ensuring interface consistency by re-structuring how content is accessed in every screen.

### Present
Since I finished my MSc degree I've been working as a researcher, mostly in mobile and web accessibility, at [Tech & People](https://techandpeople.github.io/) a research group part of [LASIGE](http://www.lasige.di.fc.ul.pt/).
